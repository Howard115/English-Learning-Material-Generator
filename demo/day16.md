## Practice Exercise Answers

### Define what tariffs are and give an example.
<span style="color: gold">**Answer:**</span> Tariffs are like those fees charged when you borrow your friend's favorite shirt. Importing costs money!

<span style="color: gold">**Explanation:**</span> Tariffs are taxes levied on imported goods to raise their prices and protect local industries. For example, a country might impose tariffs on steel to support its domestic steel producers.

<span style="color: gold">**Tips:**</span> When studying tariffs, focus on how they affect trade balance and local economies. Look for examples in news articles.

### List three reasons why countries impose sanctions.
<span style="color: gold">**Answer:**</span> 1. To make bad behavior go on vacation! ðŸŒ´ 2. To stop countries from throwing global tantrums. ðŸ˜¡ 3. To remind them that no means no! ðŸš«

<span style="color: gold">**Explanation:**</span> Countries impose sanctions mainly to punish bad behavior, deter future misdeeds, and encourage diplomatic resolutions. It's like a timeout for nations!

<span style="color: gold">**Tips:**</span> Remember that sanctions can impact trade, so be mindful of potential tariffs imposed on imports.

### Explain the importance of dialogue in conflict resolution.
<span style="color: gold">**Answer:**</span> Why did the two goats stop fighting? They wanted to have a 'baa-baa' dialogue!

<span style="color: gold">**Explanation:**</span> Dialogue fosters understanding, allowing parties to express viewpoints and seek common ground, reducing tariffs on conflict flags!

<span style="color: gold">**Tips:**</span> Focus on active listening and clarity in communication to encourage effective dialogue.

### What could be the consequences of a ceasefire in a war?
<span style="color: gold">**Answer:**</span> For one, no more popcorn sales during battle! But seriously, it could mean peace... or just a long awkward silence.

<span style="color: gold">**Explanation:**</span> A ceasefire ends direct conflict, allowing for negotiation and dialogue. However, it's often unstable and could lead to resumed fighting if issues aren't resolved.

<span style="color: gold">**Answer:**</span> Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field! That's some serious deterrent behavior!

<span style="color: gold">**Explanation:**</span> Deterrents, like a strong scarecrow, prevent actions by instilling fear or doubt. If aggressors fear consequences (like sanctions), they're less likely to act. Just like that scarecrow, the goal is to keep 'aggressive' crows at bay!

<span style="color: gold">**Tips:**</span> To better understand deterrents, consider examples from history where heavy sanctions prevented conflict, like during the Cold War.

## Discussion Question Answers

### What impact do high tariffs have on international trade?
<span style="color: gold">**Answer:**</span> High tariffs: like a bouncer at a club. Only the 'well-paying' goods get in!

<span style="color: gold">**Explanation:**</span> High tariffs make imported goods more expensive, discouraging trade. This can lead to a decrease in imports as consumers might choose domestic products instead. High prices can also lead to trade wars, where countries impose sanctions on each other's goods. The dialogue around tariffs can become heated as countries argue over trade imbalances. Overall, while tariffs aim to protect local industries, they often lead to more complex international relations that require a ceasefire in trade wars.

<span style="color: gold">**Tips:**</span> Consider how tariffs affect not just prices but relationships between countries. Explore examples of recent trade wars for a clearer view!

### How effective are sanctions in changing a country's policies?
<span style="color: gold">**Answer:**</span> Sanctions are like putting a lock on your fridgeâ€”doesn't always stop the hunger, but it'll definitely make you think twice about that midnight snack!

<span style="color: gold">**Explanation:**</span> Sanctions can put pressure on a country by discouraging certain policies, similar to how a fridge lock deters late-night snacking, but their effectiveness varies. Like tariffs, they can lead to negotiations or policy changes, especially when combined with dialogue and incentives for compliance.



### Why is dialogue often difficult in international relations?
<span style="color: gold">**Answer:**</span> Because everyone brings their own translators and you end up with a game of international charades!

<span style="color: gold">**Explanation:**</span> Dialogue is challenging in international relations due to cultural differences, conflicting interests, and the presence of historical grievances. Misunderstandings can occur, leading to confusion and ineffective communication. For example, one country may impose sanctions on another, complicating discussions further.



### What steps should be taken to achieve a lasting ceasefire?
<span style="color: gold">**Answer:**</span> Step 1: Declare a pizza party! Step 2: Peace talks over slices. Step 3: No pineapple on pizza â€“ itâ€™s a deterrent!

<span style="color: gold">**Explanation:**</span> Using humor here, a 'pizza party' symbolizes a light-hearted approach to serious discussions. A ceasefire requires open dialogue, much like sharing pizza. Furthermore, ensuring mutual respect (like respecting pizza toppings) serves as a deterrent to further conflict.

<span style="color: gold">**Tips:**</span> Encourage open dialogue, involve mediators, and ensure both sides agree on terms. Like good pizza, it should be well-balanced!

### In what ways can nations use deterrents to avoid conflicts?
<span style="color: gold">**Answer:**</span> Nations can use deterrents like sanctions; nothing discourages a bully like knowing theyâ€™ll have to share their snacks!

<span style="color: gold">**Explanation:**</span> Countries impose penalties, like sanctions, to create a negative outcome for aggressive actions, hoping to maintain peace without conflict. Examples include economic penalties or military presence.

<span style="color: gold">**Tips:**</span> Research current events to see how countries utilize deterrents. Make connections between theory and real-world examples, like tariffs in trade disputes.
